# QuasiStarSim
 QuasiStarSim is an open-source Python simulation tool that models large-scale gravitational phenomena in astrophysical environments. Generalizing beyond specific cases like HLX-1, it simulates accretion disk dynamics, quasi-star evolution, and emergent black hole formation through interactive energy profile analysis.  The tool supports reproducible experimentation and is designed for use in academic research and science education. Its modular architecture allows for integration into broader simulation workflows and exploration of various cosmic configurations.
